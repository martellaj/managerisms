# angular-node-seed

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) web app with a Node.js back-end.

The seed contains a sample Angular application configured with a Node.js back-end and is preconfigured to install the Angular framework. 

It can be used to quickly bootstrap an Angular app with Bootstrap.


## Getting Started

To use the seed, simply clone the repository (giving your repo a new name).

```
git clone https://github.com/martellaj/angular-seed.git new-project-name
```

## Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
