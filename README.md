# martellaj's Angular seed

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) web app with a Node.js backend.

This seed adheres to [John Papa's style guidelines](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

## How to use

To use the seed, simply clone the repository (giving your repo a new name).

```
git clone https://github.com/martellaj/angular-seed.git new-project-name
```

Before you forget, you should then change the remote for the repository. After you create a new repo, open up **.git/config** and replace *url* with your repository's URL. 

## Run the app

First, install all dependencies using npm.

```
npm install
```

Then, run the app by starting the server.

```
node server.js
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8080/`.
