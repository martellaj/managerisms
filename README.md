Managerisms is an app inspired by my manager, who has the most managerial and inspiring phrases that I've ever heard. A managerism is a saying that, when you hear it, you think "Wow, I get it, but wow, I would've never phrased it that way...". 

Managerisms is truly a `MEAN` application. The backend is written in Node (using the Express framework) and stores managerisms and new submissions in a MongoDB database with an Angular frontend (using Angular Material).
